# Create Veo3 Prompt Skill

Generate structured prompts for Google Veo3 video generation with scene descriptions for image-to-video workflow using a base character image.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating prompts for Veo3 image-to-video generation
- User has a base character image already
- Need scene-by-scene JSON files for video generation
- Want to generate animation and voiceover specifications

## Arguments

```
Usage: create veo3 prompt [concept] [--from-topic SLUG]

Arguments:
  concept             Description of video concept (manual mode)

Options:
  --from-topic SLUG   Load topic from library (RECOMMENDED)
                      - Reads from public/topics/{SLUG}/topic.json
                      - Includes pedagogy, cultural notes, and visual hints
                      - Visual hints adapted to realistic style with camera/lighting
                      - Generated by generate-korean-video-topic skill
```

### Example Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `create veo3 prompt "Korean greetings"` | Manual mode - gather details interactively |
| `create veo3 prompt --from-topic korean-greetings` | Library mode - use pre-generated content (RECOMMENDED) |
| `create veo3 prompt --from-topic korean-restaurant` | Library mode - includes cultural notes and formality |

## Workflow

### Step 0: Check for Library Mode (--from-topic)

If `--from-topic` flag is present, load topic from library and skip Steps 1-2.

#### Loading from Topic Library
```typescript
const topicPath = `public/topics/${slug}/topic.json`;
const topicData = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(topicPath, 'utf-8'));

// Extract scenes with realistic style adaptations
const scenes = topicData.scenes.map((scene) => ({
  scene_id: scene.scene_id,
  content: scene.content,
  image_scene_description: adaptForRealisticStyle(scene.visual),
  veo3_action: generateActionFromPose(scene.visual.pose_suggestion),
  animation: inferAnimationType(scene.visual.pose_suggestion),
  voiceover: `${scene.voiceover.korean_audio} ${scene.voiceover.explanation}`
}));
```

#### Adapting Visual Hints for Realistic/Veo3 Style
Topic library provides style-neutral poses. Adapt for Veo3 by adding camera and lighting:

```typescript
function adaptForRealisticStyle(visual: SceneVisual): string {
  const { pose_suggestion, expression, setting_hint } = visual;

  // Expand setting hint to full environment description
  const setting = expandSetting(setting_hint);

  // Add professional camera and lighting
  const camera = "Medium shot, eye level camera angle";
  const lighting = "Soft natural lighting from left side";

  return `${pose_suggestion}, ${expression}. ${setting}. ${lighting}. ${camera}.`;
}

// Example:
// Input: pose="waving hand casually", expression="bright smile", setting="school hallway"
// Output: "Waving hand casually, bright smile. School hallway with lockers and students
//          in soft focus. Soft natural lighting from left side. Medium shot, eye level camera angle."
```

#### Skip to Step 3
After loading from library, proceed directly to Step 3 (Generate Output).

---

### Step 1: Ask User for Scene Mode (Manual Mode Only)

**Skip this step if using --from-topic.**

**IMPORTANT:** Always use AskUserQuestion to determine the scene mode first.

```
How many scenes do you want to create?
- Single Scene: Create one focused scene with action and voiceover
- Multiple Scenes: Create a sequence of connected scenes for a longer video
```

### Step 2: Gather Scene Details (Manual Mode Only)

- Video concept/theme
- Number of scenes
- Content for each scene (e.g., Korean phrases, topics)
- Voiceover text for each scene

### Step 3: Generate Output

Generate THREE outputs:
1. **Image Scene Description** - For editing base image (pose, setting, expression only - NO character style)
2. **Veo3 JSON** - Complete scene file with metadata (per scene)
3. **prompts.json** - Consolidated file with all prompts for reference tracking

## Output Format

### Image Scene Description Format

**IMPORTANT:** User has a base character image. Do NOT include:
- Character appearance (age, hair, face, clothing)
- Art style (Disney, Pixar, anime, etc.)
- Character description

**DO include:**
- Pose and body position
- Hand gestures
- Facial expression
- Setting/background
- Lighting
- Camera angle

```
[Pose]: [body position, gesture]
[Expression]: [facial expression]
[Setting]: [background/environment]
[Lighting]: [lighting conditions]
[Camera]: [angle, framing]
```

### Veo3 JSON Format (Per Scene)

Each scene is a separate JSON file containing full metadata:

```json
{
  "video_concept": "[Overall video theme]",
  "character_description": "[Reference to base character]",
  "setting_description": "[Consistent background description]",
  "style": "[realistic/natural - NO cartoon styles]",
  "scene": {
    "scene_id": 1,
    "content": {
      "primary_text": "[Main text/phrase]",
      "secondary_text": "[Translation or subtitle]",
      "romanization": "[If applicable]"
    },
    "image_scene_description": "[Scene description for image editing]",
    "veo3_action": "[Motion/animation description]",
    "animation": {
      "type": "[animation_type]",
      "style": "[gentle|dynamic|natural]",
      "duration": [seconds]
    },
    "voiceover": "[Narration text]"
  }
}
```

### prompts.json Format (Consolidated Reference)

**IMPORTANT:** Always generate a `prompts.json` file in the output directory to track all prompts used. This allows the user to review which prompts were used for image and video generation.

Save to: `out/[topic-name]/prompts.json`

```json
{
  "topic": "[topic-slug]",
  "character": "[character-identifier]",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_id": 1,
      "content": {
        "korean": "[Korean text]",
        "english": "[English translation]",
        "romanization": "[Romanization]"
      },
      "image_scene_description": "[Full image scene description used for image generation]",
      "veo3_action": "[Action description used for Veo3 video generation]",
      "animation": {
        "type": "[animation_type]",
        "style": "[animation_style]",
        "duration": [seconds]
      },
      "voiceover": "[Voiceover text]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Key Fields:**
- `topic` - Slug identifier for the video topic (e.g., "korean-greetings", "school-expressions")
- `character` - Character identifier used (e.g., "female-1", "male-1")
- `scenes` - Array of all scene prompts with their exact descriptions

**Why This File is Important:**
1. **Audit Trail** - Track exactly which prompts were used for each scene
2. **Reproducibility** - Regenerate images/videos with the same prompts
3. **Debugging** - Identify which prompt caused issues if generation fails
4. **Iteration** - Easily modify and re-run specific scene prompts

## Example: Image Scene Descriptions

### Good (Scene Only - No Character Style)
```
Standing at doorway entrance, slight bow forward at 15 degrees, right hand raised in greeting wave at shoulder height, warm welcoming smile. Classroom background with wooden desks and green chalkboard. Soft morning sunlight from left side. Medium shot, eye level.
```

### Bad (Includes Character Style - DON'T DO THIS)
```
Young Korean girl, age 10, short black hair, Disney Pixar style, standing at doorway...
```

## Animation Types

- `hand_movement` - Gesturing or pointing
- `head_turn` - Head turning motion
- `walking` - Walking motion
- `talking` - Speaking animation
- `bowing` - Respectful bow motion
- `subtle_motion` - Minimal ambient movement
- `full_body` - Full body animation

## Animation Styles

- `gentle` - Smooth, calm movements
- `dynamic` - Energetic movements
- `natural` - Realistic, human-like motion
- `subtle` - Barely perceptible motion

## Best Practices

### Image Scene Description
1. **No Character Style** - User has base image, only describe pose/scene
2. **Clear Pose** - Specific body position and gestures
3. **Expression** - Describe facial expression clearly
4. **Setting** - Describe background elements
5. **Lighting** - Note lighting direction and mood

### Veo3 JSON
1. **Include Metadata** - Every scene file has video_concept, character_description, setting_description, style
2. **Realistic Style** - Use "realistic" or "natural" - no cartoon styles
3. **Motion from Pose** - Describe how the still image animates
4. **Duration** - 5-15 seconds per scene
