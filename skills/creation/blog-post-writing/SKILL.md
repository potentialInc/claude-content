## Blog Post Structure

### 1. The Hook (First 100 words)

- **Relatable story**: "Three months ago, I made a mistake that cost us $10,000..."
- **Bold claim**: "This one technique doubled our conversions overnight."

**Formula**:
```
[Attention-grabber] + [Why it matters] + [Promise of value]
```

**Example**:
> "93% of content gets zero traffic from Google. For content marketers, this statistic is terrifying—but it doesn't have to be your reality. In this post, you'll learn the exact strategies that helped us go from 0 to 50,000 monthly readers in 6 months."

### 2. The Promise
**What you'll deliver**: Set expectations early

**Formula**:
```

**Subheading Best Practices**:
- ✅ Make them descriptive: "How to Structure Your First Paragraph"

- ✅ Use numbers: "3 Techniques for Better Intros"

**Transition Phrases**:
- "Now that you understand X, let's explore Y..."
- "But here's the thing..."
- "This brings us to an important point..."
- "Let's look at an example..."
- "Here's why this matters..."

### 5. The Conclusion

**Components** (in order):
1. **Recap**: Summarize 2-3 key points
2. **Reinforce value**: Remind what they learned
3. **Call-to-action**: Give them a next step

**Formula**:
```markdown
## Conclusion

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Educational Tone
- ✅ **Clear, accessible language**: Write like you're explaining to a friend
- ✅ **Break down complex concepts**: Use analogies and examples
- ✅ **Define jargon**: If you use technical terms, explain them
- ❌ **Avoid condescension**: Don't talk down to readers

### Authoritative but Approachable
- ✅ **Share data and sources**: Back up claims with evidence
- ✅ **Use "we" and "you"**: Create conversation, not lecture
- ✅ **Show expertise**: Share insights from experience
- ❌ **Avoid being overly academic**: Keep it conversational

### Voice Variations by Audience

**B2B Tech Audience**:
- More formal, data-driven
- Industry-specific terminology okay
- Focus on ROI and business impact
- Example: "Our analysis of 500+ SaaS companies reveals..."

**B2C/General Audience**:
- Casual, conversational
- Minimal jargon
- Focus on personal benefits
- Example: "Here's the simple trick that changed everything..."

**Technical Audience**:
- Can be more technical
- Code examples, diagrams
- Focus on implementation details
- Example: "Let's dive into the algorithm..."

## Length Guidelines

| Type | Word Count | Read Time | When to Use |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| **Quick Guide** | 500-800 | 2-3 min | Simple tips, news, quick updates |
| **Standard Post** | 1,000-1,500 | 5-7 min | Most blog posts, tutorials |
| **Deep Dive** | 2,000-3,000 | 10-15 min | Comprehensive guides, thought leadership |
| **Ultimate Guide** | 3,000+ | 15+ min | Pillar content, definitive resources |

**Note**: Longer ≠ Better. Match length to complexity and audience needs.
