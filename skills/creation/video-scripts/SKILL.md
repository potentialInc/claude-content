## Writing for Different Platforms

### YouTube (5-20 minutes)

**Characteristics**:
- Can be longer and more detailed
- Needs strong hook (viewers can leave anytime)
- Chapter markers for navigation
- Optimize for suggested videos (strong CTA to next video)

**Best practices**:
- Hook in first 5 seconds
- Deliver on promise quickly
- Use pattern interrupts (visual changes every 3-5 seconds)
- Strong midroll hook ("But wait, there's more")
- End screen with next video suggestions

### Social Media (15-90 seconds)

**Instagram Reels/TikTok**:
- Ultra fast pacing
- Text overlays essential (many watch without sound)
- Hook is first 0.5 seconds
- Vertical format considerations

**LinkedIn**:
- More professional tone
- Can be slightly longer (2-3 minutes)
- Focus on business value
- Text overlays for sound-off viewing

**Template for 60-second social**:
```
[0:00-0:02] HOOK
Visual: Surprising stat or bold claim
Text overlay: "You're doing [X] wrong"

[0:02-0:10] PROBLEM
Visual: Quick problem demonstration
Text: "Most people [common mistake]"

[0:10-0:45] SOLUTION
Visual: 3-5 quick tips (rapid cuts)
Text overlays: Each tip clearly labeled
Voiceover: Explain briefly

[0:45-0:60] CTA
Visual: Your face or logo
Text: "Follow for more [content type]"
Voiceover: "Save this for later"
```

## Writing Techniques

### The Hook

**5 Hook Formulas**:

1. **Result-First**:
   > "I increased my YouTube subscribers by 10,000 in 30 days. Here's exactly how."

2. **Problem-Solution**:
   > "Struggling with [problem]? I found a solution that works in 5 minutes."

3. **Curiosity Gap**:
   > "This one setting changes everything. Most people don't know it exists."

4. **Contrarian**:
   > "Everyone says [common advice]. They're wrong. Here's why."

5. **Question**:
   > "What if I told you [surprising claim]? Watch this."

### Pacing and Rhythm

**Keep it moving**:
- ✅ Short sentences for voiceover
- ✅ One idea per breath
- ✅ Cut filler words in editing
- ✅ Vary sentence length for rhythm

**✅ Good pacing**:
> "Here's the problem. Most tutorials are too complicated. They skip steps. They assume you know things. Not this one. I'm going to walk you through every single click."

**❌ Bad pacing**:
> "The problem with most tutorials is that they tend to be overly complicated and they often skip important steps while assuming that viewers already have certain knowledge, but in this tutorial, I'm going to be different and walk you through absolutely every single step and click."

### Conversational Tone

**Write like you talk**:

**✅ Conversational**:
> "Alright, let's jump into step two. This is where it gets cool."

**❌ Formal**:
> "We will now proceed to the second step, which demonstrates an interesting feature."

**Use contractions**: "Here's" not "Here is", "you'll" not "you will"

### Visual Cues in Script

**Indicate what viewers see**:

```
===== VISUAL TRANSITION =====
[Switch to screen recording]
[Circle the subscribe button in red]
[Zoom in on this section]
[B-roll: Coffee shop workspace]
[Cut to talking head]
[On-screen text: "This is important!"]
[Arrow pointing to key element]
```

### Sound Cues

```
[SFX: Notification sound]
[Music fades out]
[Background music starts]
[Pause for emphasis]
```

## Script Formatting

### Standard Format

```
VIDEO: [Title]
LENGTH: [Target duration]
TONE: [Educational/Casual/Professional]
TARGET AUDIENCE: [Who this is for]

=====================================================

VISUAL                              |  AUDIO
                                    |
----------------------------------- | ------------------
[Describe what's on screen]         |  SPEAKER/VO:
                                    |  What is said
                                    |
[Next visual]                       |  [Next audio]
```

### Simplified Format (More Common)

```
## Hook (0:00-0:10)

[Visual: Product demo in action]

SPEAKER:
Want to build a website in 10 minutes? I'll show you how.

---

## Intro (0:10-0:30)

[Visual: Host on camera]
[Lower third: Name + Title]

SPEAKER:
Hey everyone, I'm Alex. Today we're building a complete website from scratch, and you don't need any coding experience.

[Continue]
```

## Timing and Word Count

**Speaking pace**: ~150 words per minute (WPM) conversational

**Timing estimates**:
- 1 minute = ~150 words
- 5 minutes = ~750 words
- 10 minutes = ~1500 words
- 15 minutes = ~2250 words

**Adjust for**:
- Pauses (+time)
- Screen recording demos (+time)
- Fast-paced editing (-time)

## Engagement Techniques

### Pattern Interrupts

**Change something every 3-5 seconds**:
- Camera angle
- Screen share to talking head
- Zoom level
- B-roll insert
- On-screen graphic
- Music shift

### Retention Hooks

**Throughout video**:
```
"In a minute, I'll show you the shortcut that changes everything..."
"Stick around, because the last tip is the most powerful..."
"Before we get there, you need to understand this first..."
```

### Open Loops

Create questions, answer them later:
```
"This feature has one problem—I'll tell you how to fix it in a second."
[Discuss other things]
"Remember that problem I mentioned? Here's the fix..."
```

## Calls-to-Action

### Types of CTAs

1. **Subscribe/Follow**: "If you want more [content type], subscribe"
2. **Engage**: "Drop a comment with your [question/experience]"
3. **Like/Save**: "Give this a like if you found it helpful"
4. **External link**: "Download the template in the description"
5. **Next video**: "Watch this video next to learn [related topic]"

### CTA Placement

- **Early** (0:30): Light CTA ("If you like this, subscribe")
- **Mid-roll** (50% through): Engagement CTA ("Comment your questions")
- **End** (last 30 sec): Strong CTA + next video suggestion

### CTA Best Practices

**✅ Do**:
- Give specific reason: "Subscribe for weekly tutorials"
- Make it easy: "Link in description"
- Limit to 1-2 asks at once

**❌ Don't**:
- Ask for everything: "Subscribe, like, comment, share, join, download..."
- Interrupt the value
- Be vague: "Support the channel"
