| **Purpose** | Answer one question | Answer all questions on topic |

## Structure for Long-Form Content

>

**Time Allocation**:

### Competitor Analysis

**For each top-ranking article**:
- What do they cover?
- What's missing?
- What could be explained better?
- What's outdated?
- What examples do they use?
- How is it structured?

**Create a "Content Gap" document**:
```
Article 1: Covers A, B, C. Missing D, E. Weak on examples.
Article 2: Covers A, C, D. Missing B, F. Good examples but outdated.
Article 3: Covers everything but surface-level. No framework.

Our approach: Cover A, B, C, D, E, F. Add unique framework. Include 5 case studies. Original research data.
```

**Process**:

- Keep moving forward

### Phase 3: Research Insertion (2-4 hours)

Go back and add:
- Statistics and data
- Examples and case studies

### Phase 4: Edit and Polish (3-6 hours)

**Multiple passes**:
1. **Structure pass**: Fix flow, reorder sections
2. **Clarity pass**: Simplify complex sentences
3. **Depth pass**: Add missing details
4. **Cut pass**: Remove fluff and redundancy
5. **SEO pass**: Optimize keywords, headings, links
6. **Final pass**: Grammar, spelling, formatting
