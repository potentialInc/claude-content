## Planning Process

### Step 1: Define Content Pillars (Themes)

**What**: 3-5 main topics you'll consistently cover

**Why**: Ensures content supports brand and audience needs

**Example Pillars** (SaaS company):
1. Product Education (how to use our tool)
2. Industry Insights (trends and best practices)
3. Customer Success (case studies and stories)
4. Company Culture (team and values)

**How to Choose**:
- What does your audience need to know?
- What showcases your expertise?
- What supports business goals?
- What sets you apart from competitors?

### Step 2: Set Publishing Frequency

**Determine realistic cadence**:
- Blog: 1-3x per week
- Newsletter: Weekly or bi-weekly
- Social media: Daily
- Video: Weekly or bi-weekly
- Podcast: Weekly

**Factors to consider**:
- Team capacity
- Audience expectations
- Quality over quantity
- Consistency matters more than volume

**Start conservative**: Better to publish 1x/week consistently than 3x/week sporadically

### Step 3: Map Out Key Dates

**Identify important dates**:

**Company-Specific**:
- Product launches
- Feature releases
- Company milestones
- Conference sponsorships
- Webinars or events

**Industry Events**:
- Conferences
- Industry "holidays" or awareness days
- Seasonal trends

**Calendar Events**:
- Major holidays
- Seasonal changes
- Back-to-school, end-of-year, etc.

**Example**:
```
January 15: Product launch → Series of 5 articles leading up
February 10-12: Industry conference → Pre-event, during, post-event content
March 1: Tax season begins → Financial planning content
Q2: Summer intern hiring → Culture and careers content
```

### Step 4: Brainstorm Topics

**For each content pillar, generate 10-20 topic ideas**:

**Techniques**:
- Customer FAQs
- Google "People also ask"
- Competitor content gaps
- Team expertise areas
- Industry trends
- Search keyword research
- Social media questions

**Example Brainstorm** (Product Education pillar):
- How to integrate [product] with Slack
- 5 ways to customize your workflow
- Advanced features you might have missed
- Common mistakes and how to fix them
- Power user tips and tricks

### Step 5: Organize and Schedule

**Assign topics to specific dates**:

**Balance considerations**:
- Mix content types (don't publish 4 tutorials in a row)
- Distribute pillars evenly
- Strategic timing (launches, seasons, trends)
- Production timelines (complex content needs more lead time)
- Team availability

**Work backwards from publish date**:
```
Publish Date: January 15
↓
Graphics Due: January 12 (3 days before)
↓
Final Review: January 10 (5 days before)
↓
First Draft Due: January 5 (10 days before)
↓
Research/Outline: January 1 (14 days before)
```

### Step 6: Assign Owners

**Clarify responsibility**:
- Who writes it?
- Who reviews it?
- Who handles graphics?
- Who publishes/distributes it?

**For teams**:
- Rotate assignments for variety
- Match topics to expertise
- Balance workload
- Set clear expectations

## Content Mix Strategy

- **10% Promotional**: Product updates, sales, announcements

**Or the Hub-Hero-Hygiene Model**:
- **Hygiene (70%)**: Regular, helpful content (how-tos, guides)
- **Hub (20%)**: Recurring series that build audience (weekly column, podcast)
- **Hero (10%)**: Big, ambitious pieces (ultimate guides, major campaigns)

### Balance Different Purposes

**Do**: Alternate value-add and promotional

### Balance Different Stages
