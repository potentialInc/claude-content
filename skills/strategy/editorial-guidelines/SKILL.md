# Editorial Guidelines

## Purpose
Establish comprehensive editorial standards that ensure consistent quality, style, and accuracy across all content, regardless of who creates it.

## When to Use
- Creating team writing standards
- Onboarding new content creators
- Ensuring content quality and consistency
- Defining review and approval processes
- Setting publication standards

## Editorial Guidelines vs Brand Voice

| Aspect | Brand Voice | Editorial Guidelines |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Focus** | Personality and tone | Quality and standards |
| **Covers** | How we sound | How we write technically |
| **Examples** | "Friendly but professional" | "Use Oxford comma" |
| **Purpose** | Brand consistency | Writing quality |

**They work together**: Brand voice defines personality, editorial guidelines ensure quality execution.

## Core Components

### 1. Writing Standards

**Grammar and Punctuation**:
```
Commas:
- Use Oxford comma: "lions, tigers, and bears"
- No comma before "Inc." in company names

Hyphens and Dashes:
- Use em dash (—) with no spaces for parenthetical thoughts
- Use hyphens for compound modifiers: "well-known author"
- Don't hyphenate adverbs ending in -ly: "highly skilled"

Quotation Marks:
- Use double quotes for direct speech
- Periods and commas inside quotes (American style)
- Colons and semicolons outside quotes

Apostrophes:
- Use for contractions: "don't," "we're"
- Use for possessives: "company's product," "customers' feedback"
- Its vs. it's: "Its" is possessive, "it's" means "it is"
```

**Capitalization**:
```
Headlines:
- Use sentence case: "How to build a website"
- OR title case: "How to Build a Website"
- Be consistent across all content

Product Names:
- [Your product]: Always capitalize
- [Your features]: Specify capitalization rules
- Industry terms: lowercase unless proper noun

Job Titles:
- Capitalize when used as title: "CEO Jane Smith"
- Lowercase when descriptive: "Jane Smith, our CEO"
```

**Numbers**:
```
Spell Out:
- One through nine: "five people"
- Beginning of sentence: "Fifty ways to..."

Use Numerals:
- 10 and above: "42 participants"
- Percentages: "15%" (with symbol, no space)
- Money: "$50," "$1,000," "$1 million"
- Time: "9:30 a.m." or "9:30am" (be consistent)
- Dates: "March 15, 2025" OR "15 March 2025" (pick one)

Large Numbers:
- Use million, billion: "$5 million" not "$5,000,000"
```

**Acronyms and Abbreviations**:
```
First Use:
- Spell out with acronym: "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)"
- Subsequent uses: "SEO"

Common Acronyms:
- OK to use without spelling out: API, URL, HTML, CSS, PDF
- Company-specific acronyms: Always spell out first time

State Names:
- Use two-letter abbreviations in addresses: "CA," "NY"
- Spell out in body text: "California," "New York"
```

### 2. Formatting Standards

**Headings**:
```
Structure:

- Use parallel structure in lists
```

**Lists**:
```
Bulleted Lists:
- Use for unordered items
- Capitalize first word

Numbered Lists:

Link Format:

```

**Emphasis**:
```
Bold:

- Use sparingly (loses impact if overused)
- Don't bold entire paragraphs

Italics:
- Use for book titles, publications

### 7. Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Grammar Errors**:
```
Your vs. You're:
- "Your" = possessive: "your content"
- "You're" = you are: "you're creating content"

Their vs. There vs. They're:
- "Their" = possessive: "their website"
- "There" = location: "over there"
- "They're" = they are: "they're experts"

Its vs. It's:
- "Its" = possessive: "its main feature"
- "It's" = it is: "it's important"

Affect vs. Effect:
- "Affect" (verb): "This affects performance"
- "Effect" (noun): "The effect was significant"
```

**Usage Errors**:
```
Less vs. Fewer:
- "Fewer" for countable: "fewer customers"
- "Less" for mass nouns: "less traffic"

That vs. Which:
- "That" (restrictive, no comma): "The tool that we use..."
- "Which" (non-restrictive, comma): "The tool, which costs $50..."

Who vs. Whom:
- "Who" (subject): "Who created this?"
- "Whom" (object): "To whom it may concern"
- If unsure, rephrase or use "who" (less formal but usually acceptable)
```

**Style Inconsistencies**:
```
❌ Don't Mix:
- "Five products and 12 features" → Use numerals consistently
- "March 5th" and "June 6" → Pick date format
- "9:00am" and "3:00 p.m." → Consistent time format
- "email" and "e-mail" → Pick one spelling

✅ Be Consistent:
- Throughout a piece
- Across all content
- Update guidelines when you change standards
