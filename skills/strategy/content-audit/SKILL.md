# Content Audit

## Purpose
Systematically analyze your existing content to identify what's working, what's not, and opportunities for optimization, consolidation, or removal.

## When to Use
- Starting a new content strategy
- Content performance is declining
- Planning a website redesign
- Annual content review
- Before creating new content (avoid duplication)
- Identifying content gaps

## What is a Content Audit

**Definition**: A comprehensive analysis of all content on your website or platform to assess quality, performance, and alignment with goals.

**Not just**: A list of pages
**But**: Strategic evaluation of content effectiveness

## Audit Benefits

**Why Conduct Audits**:
- Identify top performers (do more of what works)
- Find underperforming content (fix or remove)
- Discover content gaps
- Eliminate duplicate or outdated content
- Improve SEO by updating and consolidating
- Align content with current strategy
- Save resources (update vs. create new)

## Audit Types

### Comprehensive Audit

**Scope**: Every piece of content
**When**: Annual review, major strategy shift
**Time**: 2-4 weeks for large sites

**Scope**: Specific content type or section
**When**: Optimizing one area (e.g., blog)
**Time**: 3-5 days

```

### Phase 2: Analyze (Evaluate)

**Assess each piece**:

**Quantitative Metrics**:

```

### Phase 3: Categorize (Prioritize)

- Aligns with strategy

**Action**: Leave as is, maybe minor updates

**Actions**:
- Merge similar articles into comprehensive piece

### Phase 4: Act (Execute)

**Prioritize improvements**:

**Priority Matrix**:

Low Impact + Easy Fix = Quick Wins (batch)
Low Impact + Hard Fix = Defer or Delete
```

**Create Action Plan**:
```
Content Piece: [URL/Title]
Current Status: [Category]
Issues Identified:
- [Issue 1]
- [Issue 2]

Action Items:
- [Action 1] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]
- [Action 2] - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

Expected Outcome: [What success looks like]
Priority: High/Medium/Low
```

### Phase 5: Monitor (Track)

- Ranking improvements
- Engagement increases

**Ongoing Monitoring**:
- Set up regular reviews (quarterly)
- Monitor updated content performance
- Adjust strategy based on results

## Detailed Analysis

### Performance Analysis

**Traffic Analysis**:
```
High Traffic (Top 20%):
- What's working? (format, topic, promotion)
- Can we create more like this?
- Can we update to perform even better?

Low Traffic (Bottom 20%):
- Why is it underperforming?
- Is the topic still relevant?
- Is it optimized for search?
- Should we improve or delete?
```

**Engagement Analysis**:
```
High Engagement:
- Long time on page
- Low bounce rate
- High scroll depth
- Comments/shares

Low Engagement:
- High bounce rate
- Short time on page
- Few shares/comments

Questions to Ask:

```

**Conversion Analysis**:
```
High Converting:

✅ **Do**: Let metrics guide decisions

### 3. Update Before Creating New
❌ **Don't**: Always create new content
✅ **Do**: Update existing high-performers first

### 4. Document Everything
❌ **Don't**: Make changes without tracking
✅ **Do**: Record before/after metrics

### 5. Set Realistic Timeline
❌ **Don't**: Try to fix everything in a week
