# Brand Voice

## Purpose
Define and document your brand's unique voice and tone to ensure consistent, authentic communication across all channels and team members.

## When to Use
- Creating brand voice guidelines
- Onboarding new content creators
- Ensuring consistency across channels
- Defining brand personality
- Training team on brand communication
- Auditing existing content for consistency

## Voice vs Tone

**Voice**: Your brand's personality—consistent across all content
**Tone**: How voice adapts to different situations—varies by context

**Analogy**:
- **Voice** = Your personality (always you)
- **Tone** = Your mood/expression (changes based on situation)

**Example**:
- **Voice**: Friendly, helpful, knowledgeable
- **Tone** (Welcome email): Warm, excited
- **Tone** (Error message): Apologetic, helpful
- **Tone** (Technical docs): Professional, clear

## Defining Your Brand Voice

### Step 1: Identify Voice Attributes

**Choose 3-5 attributes that define your brand personality**:

**Common voice attributes**:
- Friendly
- Professional
- Casual
- Authoritative
- Playful
- Serious
- Warm
- Direct
- Conversational
- Formal
- Witty
- Educational
- Empathetic
- Bold
- Approachable

**Voice framework template**:
```
We are [attribute 1] but not [opposite extreme]
We are [attribute 2] but not [opposite extreme]
We are [attribute 3] but not [opposite extreme]
```

**Example (Mailchimp)**:
- We are **fun** but not **childish**
- We are **confident** but not **cocky**
- We are **smart** but not **stodgy**
- We are **informal** but not **sloppy**

**Example (Slack)**:
- We are **clear** but not **blunt**
- We are **fun** but not **childish**
- We are **humble** but not **insecure**
- We are **helpful** but not **overbearing**

### Step 2: Define What You Are AND What You're Not

**Format**:
```
✅ We ARE:
- [Characteristic 1]
- [Characteristic 2]
- [Characteristic 3]

❌ We are NOT:
- [Opposite 1]
- [Opposite 2]
- [Opposite 3]
```

**Example**:
```
✅ We ARE:
- Friendly and conversational
- Knowledgeable but not condescending
- Clear and direct
- Optimistic but realistic

❌ We are NOT:
- Corporate or stuffy
- Overly technical or jargon-filled
- Sarcastic or cynical
- Pushy or sales-y
```

### Step 3: Create Example Scenarios

**Show voice in action across different situations**:

**Template**:
```
Situation: [Specific scenario]

❌ Not our voice:
[Example that misses the mark]

✅ Our voice:
[Example that nails it]

Why: [Explanation]
```

**Example**:
```
Situation: User encounters an error

❌ Not our voice:
"Error 404. The requested resource could not be found."

✅ Our voice:
"Hmm, we can't find that page. Let's get you back on track."

Why: We're helpful and conversational, not technical and cold.
```

### Step 4: Write Do's and Don'ts

**Specific writing guidance**:

**Example**:
```
✅ DO:
- Use contractions (we're, don't, it's)
- Write like you talk
- Use "you" and "we"
- Keep sentences short and clear
- Use active voice
- Add personality with word choice

❌ DON'T:
- Use corporate jargon ("leverage synergies")
- Write in passive voice
- Use buzzwords ("disrupt," "paradigm shift")
- Be overly formal ("Dear valued customer")
- Use all caps for emphasis (unless an emergency)
```

## Voice Dimensions

### Formality Spectrum

**Formal → Casual**

**Formal**:
> "We appreciate your business and look forward to serving your needs."

**Balanced**:
> "Thanks for choosing us. We're here to help!"

**Casual**:
> "Hey! Glad you're here. Let's get started."

**Your brand position**: [Define where you fall]

### Respectful → Irreverent

**Respectful**:
> "We understand this is frustrating. Here's how we can help."

**Balanced**:
> "This is annoying, we know. Let's fix it."

**Irreverent**:
> "Well, that's not supposed to happen. Oops."

### Enthusiastic → Matter-of-fact

**Enthusiastic**:
> "We're so excited to announce our new feature! 🎉"

**Balanced**:
> "We just released a new feature you might find useful."

**Matter-of-fact**:
> "New feature available. Details below."

### Serious → Humorous

**Serious**:
> "Data security is our top priority. We use bank-level encryption."

**Balanced**:
> "Your data is safe with us—we take security seriously."

**Humorous**:
> "Your data is locked down tighter than Fort Knox. Well, almost."

## Vocabulary Guidelines

### Words We Use

**List words and phrases that embody your voice**:

**Example**:
```
We say:          Instead of:
- Hey            - Dear customer
- Help out       - Assist
- Start          - Initiate
- Easy           - User-friendly
- Learn          - Discover
- Fix            - Resolve
```

### Words We Avoid

**Jargon, clichés, or off-brand language**:

**Example**:
```
❌ Avoid:
- Synergy
- Leverage
- Paradigm
- Disrupt
- Revolutionary
- Game-changing
- World-class
- Best-in-class
- At the end of the day
- Think outside the box
```

### Writing Patterns

**Sentence structure and style**:

**Example**:
```
✅ We prefer:
- Short sentences. Punchy. Easy to scan.
- Questions that engage readers
- Lists and bullet points
- One idea per sentence

❌ We avoid:
- Run-on sentences that pile multiple clauses and ideas together making them hard to follow
- Passive voice constructions
- Complex vocabulary when simple words work
- Unnecessary qualifiers and hedging (somewhat, perhaps, possibly)
```

## Tone Variations by Context

**Define how tone shifts while voice stays consistent**:

### Success/Celebration

**When**: User accomplishes something, positive news

**Tone**: Enthusiastic, congratulatory

**Example**:
> "Woohoo! You just published your first blog post. That's awesome!"

### Error/Problem

**When**: Something goes wrong, user frustrated

**Tone**: Apologetic, helpful, clear

**Example**:
> "Oops, something went wrong. Here's how to fix it: [clear steps]"

### Onboarding/Education

**When**: Teaching new users, explaining features

**Tone**: Patient, encouraging, clear

**Example**:
> "Let's start with the basics. First, you'll create your profile. Take your time—we'll walk you through each step."

### Marketing/Sales

**When**: Promoting product, trying to convert

**Tone**: Enthusiastic but not pushy, benefit-focused

**Example**:
> "Ready to save 10 hours a week? Our automation tools do the repetitive work so you can focus on what matters."

### Technical/Documentation

**When**: API docs, troubleshooting, technical guides

**Tone**: Clear, precise, helpful

**Example**:
> "To authenticate, include your API key in the Authorization header: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`"

### Serious/Sensitive Topics

**When**: Security issues, pricing changes, service disruptions

**Tone**: Serious, transparent, respectful

**Example**:
> "We're changing our pricing on March 1st. Here's exactly what's changing and why."

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### Website Copy

**Characteristics**:

### Social Media

**Characteristics**:
- Personal and direct
- Conversational
- Action-oriented
- One clear CTA

**Example**:
```
❌ Not our voice:
"Error: Invalid input detected in field 'email'. Please correct and resubmit."

✅ Our voice:
"Hmm, that email address doesn't look quite right. Mind double-checking it?"
```

## Grammar and Mechanics

### Punctuation

**Exclamation points**:
- ✅ Use sparingly for genuine excitement
- ❌ Don't overuse (looks unprofessional!!!)
- Limit: 1 per email, 1-2 per long blog post

**Em dashes**:
- ✅ Use for parenthetical thoughts—like this—when commas feel too weak
- Format: No spaces around em dash (like this—not this — or this - )

**Ellipses**:
- ✅ Use to indicate trailing off or pauses...
- ❌ Don't overuse (looks uncertain)

### Capitalization

**Headlines/Titles**:
- Sentence case: "How to build a website in 10 minutes"
- OR Title case: "How to Build a Website in 10 Minutes"
- Be consistent

**Product/Feature Names**:
- [Specify your conventions]
- Example: "Content Calendar" (capitalized) or "content calendar" (lowercase)

### Numbers

**When to spell out**:
- One through nine: spell out
- 10 and up: use numerals
- Exception: Start of sentence (spell out)

**Example**:
- "We have three locations and 47 employees."
- "Fifty ways to improve your content" (sentence start)

### Contractions

- ✅ Use them (we're, don't, it's) → conversational
- ❌ Avoid them (we are, do not, it is) → formal

**Your brand**: [Specify preference]

3. Does it resonate with our audience?
4. Can team members apply it consistently?
5. Does it work across all channels?

### Voice Consistency Check

**For any piece of content, ask**:
- [ ] Uses our preferred vocabulary?
- [ ] Matches our formality level?
- [ ] Tone appropriate for context?

- [ ] Aligns with brand personality?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Too Many Attributes
❌ **Don't**: List 10 voice attributes
✅ **Do**: Focus on 3-5 core attributes

### 2. Too Vague
❌ **Don't**: "We're professional and friendly"
✅ **Do**: "We're friendly—like a knowledgeable coworker, not a best friend. We use contractions and humor but never slang."

### 3. No Examples
❌ **Don't**: Just list attributes
✅ **Do**: Show real before/after examples

### 4. Set It and Forget It
❌ **Don't**: Create guide and never update
✅ **Do**: Review and refine quarterly

### 5. Not Enforcing It
❌ **Don't**: Create guide but don't train team
✅ **Do**: Make it mandatory reading and part of review process
