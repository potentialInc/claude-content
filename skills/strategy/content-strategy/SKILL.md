## What is Content Strategy

**Definition**: A plan for creating, publishing, and managing content that serves both business goals and audience needs.

**Not just**: A content calendar or publishing schedule

**Common goals**:
- Increase brand awareness

**Make goals specific and measurable**:

❌ **Vague**: "Get more traffic"

**Template**:
```
Primary Goal: [What you want to achieve]
Success Metric: [How you'll measure it]
Target: [Specific number and timeframe]
Why This Matters: [Business impact]
```

**Example**:
```
Primary Goal: Generate qualified leads
